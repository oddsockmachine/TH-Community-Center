- [ ] editing bookings (might have to re-enable moving blocks around in calendar widget)
- [ ] block bookings - basics done, need to consider more complex use cases
- [ ] install postgresql for production and to enable migrations
- [ ] public/private events. upcoming events should only show public. Extra tickbox in booking add form
- [ ] prettify add form and disable editing of date fields and posting if incomplete (currently this is checked after posted, and an error message is given)
- [x] calendar link should lead to booking tutorial/guide
- [ ] ask more information when signing up - what group they represent etc
- [ ] see if can show time on vertical and rooms on horizontal axis for more space - probably not with this widget
- [ ] actually send confirmation to user email- see: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mezzanine-users/D0OoaALImx
- [ ] make contact form work
- [ ] return non-generic error message when booking submit fails
- [ ] prevent booking in the past
- [ ] require booking in advance eg with 48hr/1wk notice
- [ ] bookings/calendar loads *all* bookings as bg dump of json. Should instead load only this week/month, and use callbacks on "next"/"prev" buttons to load more data when needed. Not a problem right now, but after months of use this could slow things down.
- [ ] give a reason for booking rejection, email to owner
- [ ] setup twitter integration - need to get api token from manager. http://theneum.com/blog/django-mezzanine-twitter-setup/
- [ ] Should we remind users when their block bookings are about to run out?
- [ ] Billing and Invoicing. At least provide paypal link in confirmation email. Must deal with eg: block bookings where some are cancelled.

reminders:
- /calendar add booking form isn't using autogenerated fields, do must be manually updated when schema changes
