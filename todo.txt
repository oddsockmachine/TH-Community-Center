see if can show time on vertical and rooms on horizontal axis for more space - probably not with this widget
actually send confirmation to user email: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mezzanine-users/D0OoaALImx    o
make contact form work
return non-generic error message when booking submit fails
prevent booking in the past
require booking in advance eg with 48hr/1wk notice
bookings/calendar loads *all* bookings as bg dump of json. Should instead load only this week/month, and use callbacks on "next"/"prev" buttons to load more data when needed. Not a problem right now, but after months of use this could slow things down.
give a reason for booking rejection, email to owner

Should we remind users when their block bookings are about to run out?


reminders:
/calendar add booking form isn't using autogenerated fields, do must be manually updated when schema changes
